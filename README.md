# Capstone 2 â€“ Signal Classification Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on **classifying signal data** using machine learning techniques.  
We perform **data preprocessing**, **feature scaling**, **dimensionality reduction (PCA)**,  
and train multiple ML models to find the best-performing classifier.

The final model and preprocessing pipeline are saved for future use.
